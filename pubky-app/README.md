## About

This is the Pubky-app MVP presented in BTC Prague, currently live at https://pubky.app

Pubky App is a social-media-like experience built over [Pubky Core](https://pubky.org/). It serves as a working example on how to build over Pubky Core to create simple or complex applications. Its social components (profiles, tagging, etc) are intended for re-use in any other Pubky application that requires social features.

This repository holds the frontend application for the social Pubky App. For the specialized backend (aggregator/indexer/API) check out [Pubky-Nexus](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-nexus).
